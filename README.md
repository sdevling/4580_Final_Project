### Contents of Final Project:

This final project contains multiple files. *Simulation.py* contains the python code used to simulate the project, including policy classes, batching, and validation work. 

*test_data* contains the CSV files used for project analysis. *main_report.ipynb* contains the written report and technical appendices. 

### Instructions for Running the Final Report:

In order to run the final report, open *main_report.ipynb* and run all python scripts. It is not necessary to import any CSV files, as these are accessed through a github link 
that is already coded into the report.
